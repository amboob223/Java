so in intelij
    when wecreate diffrent classes in java they are atuomatically able to inherit from other classes because of how its set up.

when populatin g a loop in java we can do it declarativly or with a loop

what we learned today that the inhertence happens automaticcaly o this intelij ide
we learned that to see the elementys of an arry we gott  to use a for loop and to populate w
we got to intialize the size first and the the data typre like int[] etc. but if i was ussing
a diffrent package for inheritence i might have to make all the classes in tyhe same package
to make the hash we got to import the java.util.hashmap package and then hash<> we got to specify thekey and value type
a field is a varibale java defines inside a class
implicit casting is when java redefindes the data type when we concatenate or put two diffrent data types on the same line

the next method only return one token
so us the next line instead nextfloat and next it allows us to put multiple tokens in the output
Scanner is so we can get user input in the terminal directly .
we are makijng command line apps right now.
controling the flow of execution is control flow in java
    -comparisoon == compares objects this is diffrent frim the .equals that checks values

    -logical operarors

    -conditional statements
        -switch statemnts executes parts of code depending on if a condition meets a certain value
            -takes case clauses if its a value doe this
            -we got to ad break statemnts to break out the case
            -we can have a default clause if none of the conditions are met
    - loops
        - best to create the scanner objects outside of the loop because it can polute memeory just the constructor part outside of the loop
        - while loops are usefule when we dont know how many times we wantt o reproduce the ocde
        -do.while loops get executed at least once and use the do key word byu its like a while loop
       break and continue?
       -for each loop
            -used to iterate over arrays or collections

       //arrays when making an array we can use java.util.arrayLoist
            - that alklows dynamic arrays that can change in size

        // format specifiers
            %d,%f,%s,%b,%c then at the end of the string you got to put in the variables
            -printf method uses specifiers

         -scanner needs to be closed
