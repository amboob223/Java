so in intelij
    when wecreate diffrent classes in java they are atuomatically able to inherit from other classes because of how its set up.

when populatin g a loop in java we can do it declarativly or with a loop

what we learned today that the inhertence happens automaticcaly o this intelij ide
we learned that to see the elementys of an arry we gott  to use a for loop and to populate w
we got to intialize the size first and the the data typre like int[] etc. but if i was ussing
a diffrent package for inheritence i might have to make all the classes in tyhe same package
to make the hash we got to import the java.util.hashmap package and then hash<> we got to specify thekey and value type
